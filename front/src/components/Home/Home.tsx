                    By default, the game ends when a player get 3 points. You can move right or left by pressing the appropriate arrow key.<br/>
                    If you have the extra features on you can press both left and right to elevate your paddle in order to gain an advantage!<br/>
                    To reduce the lag, the game runs both in the front and in the back, so that the game can anticipate frames if it doesn&apos;t receive them from the back.<br/>
                    You can create a custom match, choose how many points are needed to win and invite a friend to join you.<br/><br/>

                    When the game ends, you get or lose some points and you can go back to the game lobby to play again.
